# Problem Set 2

## Instructions:
The pdf has all the basic instructions, but here are some additional guidelines.
- [ ] Code for Problem 1 should be done in the file called `Prob1.py` in the repository. This is another Karel program and has additional worlds called `1x8.w`, `5x5.w`, `5x3.w`, and `8x1.w`. 
- [ ] Code for Problem 2 should be done in the file called `Prob2.py`. The template is very sparse here on purpose, as you are defining the desired function.
- [ ] Code for Problem 3 should be done in `Prob3.txt`! Here you are just writing out in plain text how you would accomplish the problem. You can edit this file and type out your solution in VSCode just like with the others. In case you find it useful, the animations of the overlapping objects can be seen below:

Please remember to fill out the meta-information at the top of each file! At the very least, be clear about if you worked with anyone.

If you have issues or come across problems or parts of the instructions that are unclear, please don't hesitate to ask on Discord or email or in person!
